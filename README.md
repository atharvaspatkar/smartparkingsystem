# smartparkingsystem
Our proposed system presents a smart parking system that regulates a number of vehicles to the nearest parking space at any given time based on the parking space availability. “Intelligent Parking System (IPS)” is implemented using the Operating System Android. The user requests the Parking Control Unit to check the status of available parking slots. As soon as the user request, all the available free slots are displayed to the user.

LITERATURE REVIEW :

In present days we are facing many problems with the existing car parking system. As we need to park our car manually and there is no discipline in this process it creates a huge hurdle and a lot of chaos.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The time to find an empty parking slot is minimized. The main responsibility of our proposed system is to help the user to find an area where parking is available and total number of slots free in that area. Thus our proposed methodology reduces the user’s effort and time of searching a parking slot..

When a car arrives at the entrance, Using the android application on his android device, the user commands the Parking Control Unit to check the status of available parking slots. On receiving this command, a search for free slot is carried out and corresponding information is provided to the user . The car traces its path to the entrance of the parking area.
 The user can search the parking area through the android application and pre book that slot. The proposed system is based on client-server architecture.
For the processing at first step, user needs to install the android application on his android based device. After installation the icon of the app will display on the home screen of the user’s device. Then the user has to register his details with the application for the first time. This is one time registration. The user has to enter details such as name, address, gender and mobile number. All the data will be stored on server.
In this the client is provided with multiple parking locations. Client has to select one of the locations where he desires to park the vehicle. Based on the availability parking slots will be displayed on client’s device . Colour coding is used to indicate the empty or reserved spot,if the parking slot is free it will be indicated by green colour and if the slot is full it will be indicated by the red colour. If the required space is available then the client can proceed. The parking at crowded places can be handled through this parking system.
